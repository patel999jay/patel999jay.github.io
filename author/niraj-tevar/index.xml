      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;A low profile, electrically small with omnidirectional vertically polarized radiation similar to a short monopole antenna is presented
for UHF (400-520 MHz) band. It has compact and mechanically stable structure for mounting on to the roof of the Heavy duty
vehicles such as Trains. It can also be employed with a ground plane (roof surface/rooftop) as in vehicle antenna is consider
advantageous because the desired direction of communication are mostly independent of the orientation of the vehicle. The proposed
antenna is made up of the compact size to reduce the overall antenna dimension. The simulation is carried out by using CST
Microwave Studio Program. The effect of the antenna parameters on the impedance bandwidth will be investigated. It is easily
embedded on the roof of the vehicle. Moreover, It has simple structure, low profile, easily mounted and relative good bandwidth
(BW). It is also shown that this antenna is nearly omnidirectional over a majority fraction of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;A proposed work present UHF (400-520 MHz) low-profile (compact size) antenna for mounting on to the roof of the space constrained auto motives such as Trains, with omnidirectional vertically polarized radiation. The proposed design has less than λ/32 dimension in height. It can also be mounted with a ground plane (roof surface/rooftop). The geometry of the proposed antenna is taken from a short monopole antenna fed at appropriate location for proper impedance matching. The distance between the shorting end and antenna radiator is given by λ/8 and proper feeding position can enable it to match to 50 Ω coaxial line. The antenna is designed and simulated by CST Microwave Studio Program. The effect of the antenna parameters on the bandwidth will be investigated. Moreover, the proposed antenna, easily mounted on vehicle roof, has small dimensions, low profile, easy mounting and relatively good bandwidth (BW). It is also shown that this antenna is nearly omnidirectional in azimuth plane over a majority fraction of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
