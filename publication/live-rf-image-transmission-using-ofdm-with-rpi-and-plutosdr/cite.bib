ABSTRACT="Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier
digital communication technique which solves most of the digital
communication problems such as inter-symbol interference (ISI), lower data
rate, inter-carrier interference (ICI). It adds up an excessive amount of
low data rate carriers to assemble high data rate communication system.
Each low data rate carrier provides enough long symbol periods, which
results in eliminating ISI. Orthogonality enables excellent feature
providing each carrier a way to be closed spaced, although overlapped
without ICI. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate the
OFDM concept in real time RF Communication while investigating its critical
performance analysis. This framework integrates more than one embedded
platforms such as RPi, Analog PlutoSDR and MATLAB. This may be an efficient
way to transmit live images/video feed from one place to another for
surveillance purposes. This research is more focused on transmitting live
image taken with constant rate from Rpi video-camera to Analog Pluto, which
transmit image over Radio channel and receive the same with different
PlutoSDR at remote location."
