      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;Low-frequency ship noise negatively impacts marine ecosystems and interferes with marine mammal communications. In an effort to manage and reduce ship noise in marine environments, high-fidelity propagation loss measurements were conducted across multiple locations to develop a principled shallow water ranging methodology that improves the accuracy of shallow water ship ranging. This paper reports on a proposed propagation loss procedure and presents preliminary results from in-water tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;Calibrated acoustic projectors, driven by a programmable function generator, were used to simulate different types of ship noise. A surface-mounted, near-field hydrophone, and a pair of bottom-mounted, far-field hydrophones were used to receive the acoustic signals. Propagation loss (PL) was estimated from the near-field and far-field hydrophones to yield source level (SL) estimates. These SL estimates were compared with the calibrated acoustic projector&#39;s known source levels to verify the propagation loss accuracy. Future work will further develop PL estimation, resulting in a shallow water ranging technique with a performance comparable to that of deep water ranging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
